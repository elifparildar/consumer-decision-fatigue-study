# Consumer Decision Fatigue in Online Choice

## Overview
This project examines how the number of available options and the presence of popularity cues influence consumer decision fatigue, decision satisfaction, and purchase intention in an online decision-making context.

The study uses an experimental survey design in which participants were randomly assigned to different choice conditions.

## Research Question
How do choice overload and popularity cues affect decision fatigue and related consumer outcomes during online purchase decisions?

## Method
- Experimental online survey design
- Multiple choice conditions (low vs. high choice, with and without popularity cues)
- Self-report measures of decision fatigue, satisfaction, and purchase intention
- Analysis conducted using R

## Data
The dataset consists of anonymized participant responses collected via an online survey platform.

Due to ethical considerations and participant privacy, the raw dataset is not publicly shared. Variable definitions and analysis code are provided for transparency and reproducibility.

## Key Results (Summary)
